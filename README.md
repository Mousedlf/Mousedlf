### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p>Welcome to my GitHub, I am Caroline, a French student living in Lyon. I completed a bachelor's degree in Design (web design as my specialty). I am currently in my second year of a Bachelor's degree in web development.</p>
<p>I do back-end as well as front-end development. My most used framework is probably Symfony.</p>
